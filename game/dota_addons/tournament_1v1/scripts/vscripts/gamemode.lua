	This function should be used to set up Async precache calls at the beginning of the gameplay.

	In this function, place all of your PrecacheItemByNameAsync and PrecacheUnitByNameAsync.  These calls will be made
	after all players have loaded in, but before they have selected their heroes. PrecacheItemByNameAsync can also
	be used to precache dynamically-added datadriven abilities instead of items.  PrecacheUnitByNameAsync will 
	precache the precache{} block statement of the unit and all precache{} block statements for every Ability# 
	defined on the unit.

	This function should only be called once.  If you want to/need to precache more items/abilities/units at a later
	time, you can call the functions individually (for example if you want to precache units in a new wave of
	holdout).

	This function should generally only be used if the Precache() function in addon_game_mode.lua is not working.
